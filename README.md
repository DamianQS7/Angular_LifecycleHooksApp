# Lifecycle Hooks App

The purpose of this app is to gain a deeper understanding of the Components Lifecyle Hooks in Angular.
All the examples will work through a minimal implementation in the UI, and everything else will be handled
through the console.

### Disclaimer

The original idea for this app belongs to Fernando Herrera from DevTalles.
I only introduced some small changes, and built a couple of extra examples on top of it.
